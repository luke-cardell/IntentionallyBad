Intentionally Bad
Written by Luke Cardell
ReadMe last updated 11/17/2018

This is a repository for intentionally bad code,
be it in implementation, style, or function. It is
my firm belief that poorly written code serves a
purpose more fundamental to the nature of learning
to program than clean, well-structured, and
consistent code. It is the poorly written code
that, through experience and redesign, we learn
the most from.

None of the code in this repository is intended to
be used in a malicious fashion. Some of it may do
stupid or useless things, but none of it is
intentionally harmful.

All code in this repository is open source under
the Gnu Public License.
